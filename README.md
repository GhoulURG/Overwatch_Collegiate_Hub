# Overwatch Collegiate Hub (OCH)

## Project Description
Overwatch Collegiate Hub (OCH) is a web application designed to centralize information about collegiate Overwatch across multiple conferences, including NECC, ECAC, CECC, and Overwatch Collegiate. The platform provides real-time standings, match results, player and team profiles, schedules, and news highlights, making it easier for players, coaches, fans, and recruiters to track competitive activity.  

Currently, information about collegiate Overwatch is fragmented across multiple websites and social media channels. OCH solves this by offering a single, unified platform for all stakeholders, providing both real-time updates and historical data analytics.
